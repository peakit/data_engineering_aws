# #### Creating list of filepaths to process original event csv data files

# In[112]:

# ## Now you are ready to work with the CSV file titled <font color=red>event_datafile_new.csv</font>, located within the Workspace directory.  The event_datafile_new.csv contains the following columns: 
# - artist

# - gender of user
# - item number in session
# - last name of user
# - length of the song
# - level (paid or free song)
# - location of the user
# - sessionId
# - song title
# - userId
